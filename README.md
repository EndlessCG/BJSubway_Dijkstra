# BJSubway_Dijkstra
A distance&amp;price calculator for part of Beijing Metro. Based on Dijkstra algorithms.
The price of metro tickets of Beijing since 2014 are decided on the distance the passengers cover. Therefore, if we figure out the shortest route between two stations, we can calculate the price of a ticket. In this project, we do so using Dijkstra algorithm. We use a weighted graph to represent the map of the metro, and use the weight to represent the distance between each two stations.
